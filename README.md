# RandPlayNX
A simple homebrew tool for NX to start a random game from your game library.
Hope this time you can actually play your games without the need of a painful choice. ^___^

## How to use:
* First of all, count all your games in your Switch library. You can do it faster by counting lines at the All Games screen first, then multiple it by 6 and add the additional X<6 if needed.
* So, you have 128 games installed for example.
* Then launch the app, press A.
* Enter the number your of games (128).
* Maroon is a number of horizontal oines to skip
* Yellow number is the number of actual game to play on the next row.
* Press B and run your game that was choosen by Random God (well, actually, it's a rand() seeded by your local timestamp). ^_^

Tested with FW 10.0.2, CFW atmosphÃ©re 0.12.0.
