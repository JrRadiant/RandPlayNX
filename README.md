# RandPlayNX
A simple homebrew tool for NX to help you start a random game from your game library.
Hope this time you can actually play your games without the need of a painful choice. ^___^

Tested with FW 10.0.2, CFW atmosph√©re 0.12.0.

## How to use:
* First of all, count all your games in your Switch library. You can do it faster by counting lines at the All Games screen first, then multiple it by 6 and add the additional X<6 if needed.
* So, you have 128 games installed for example. (No more than 3000 games, please. ^^)
* Then launch the app, press A.
* Enter the number your of games (128).
* Maroon is a number of horizontal lines to skip
* Yellow number is the number of actual game to play on the next row.
* Press B and run your game that was choosen by Random God! ^_^ (Well, actually, it's a rand() seeded by your local timestamp.)

You can use nsp forwarder from here (base64-encoded): aHR0cHM6Ly9hbm9uZmlsZS5jb20vVGYyOG9kdWZvNy9SYW5kUGxheU5YXzA1MTY5ODZFQzQwMjAwMDBfbnNw
